# Linear Regression House Price Prediction

This project uses a linear regression model to predict house prices based on a housing dataset.  
The steps include:
- Loading and cleaning the data  
- Exploring feature relationships and distributions  
- Training a linear regression model  
- Evaluating model performance (residuals, errors)  
- Visualising results (feature importances, predictions vs actual)  

The dataset used: `Housing.csv`  
The main code file: `main.py`
